    <p>Hi, welcome to this little thing i made for getting back the "Old Web".<br> Just know, as of right now, this is a kinda beta state and currently (for what i know), only works in Chrome and i do not plan on extending that.<br>Also, note that most this stuff for the old web is made by others and NOT ME. I credited them in the links to the downaloads and such.<br>Thanks!</p>
