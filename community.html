      <p><strong>(time for a random rant about 2000's web. yippppeee)</strong><br>
        i'd like to say that i personally LOVE the old web design. I honestly don't know why but something about it is just 
        <a href="/oldwebsignup.html">amusing.</a><br>
        personally, i would pay good money to go back in time for even just a day to a time through 2013‚Äì2018, since i liked those time periods of gaming, youtube, and other stuff... OR, 2004‚Äì2013, as those were some good times for the internet as a whole to grow. not to mention frutiger aero was the PEAK of web design. although then again, my opinions always tend to be bad, but STILL. it was truly just great.
